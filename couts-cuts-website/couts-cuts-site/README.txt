## How to use your logo
1. Save the logo image you shared into this folder at: `assets/logo.png`  
2. Keep the filename exactly `logo.png`.  
3. Reload the page — the site will use your logo automatically.  
   (If `logo.png` is missing, a placeholder SVG is shown.)

## Contact form (email)
Right now the form opens your email app using a `mailto:` link.  
If you want form submissions to go to a specific email **without** opening an app,
use a service like Formspree or Basin and replace the form's JS with their snippet.

## Publish on GoDaddy (cPanel / File Manager)
1. Unzip the file.
2. Upload everything (including the `assets` folder) to your site's web root (often `public_html/`).
3. If your domain points to that hosting, visit it in a browser — you’re live.
